# SWapiBox
#### An informative React-based app that utilizes asynchronous JS/API calls to the Star Wars API

## Installation Steps
- Clone the repo: ```git clone https://github.com/ericweissman/swapibox.git```
- Install dependencies: ```npm install```
- Start Local Host: ```npm start```
- For testing suite: ```npm test```

## Background/About
SWapiBox was the first project I made using asynchronous JS and API calls. The data from the Star Wars API contains nested URLs that are required to gather more information. This application utilizes asynchronous API calls to render the information without causing issues for other components to render.

## Primary Technologies Used
- React
- Async JS
- SCSS
- Jest
- Enzyme
